 ## Description:

##### ___born2beroot is a project where we learn a little about virtualization and configuring it a little bit like a server!!!___

- we need to choose between two os', Debian and Rocky.
- we learn about some system features (like crontabs) and a little bit about scripts.
- bonus part is about partioning and building a server, did the partitions but not the server :(.
